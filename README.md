# README

- When starting the Rails server using bin/rails server use the following command instead: bin/rails server -b 0.0.0.0. This will allow access to the app from our host machine. This is a Vagrant-specific nuance, which is why it's not mentioned in their guide.

- Once the server is running, navigate to it on localhost:3000 and explore the different areas and features.
